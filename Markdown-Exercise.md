[^1]:** My Footnote
[^2]: All information on this markdown page was source from WH.gov
[^3]: I would have included this footnote at the bottom except that everything after my python script was included in that cell and I could not figure out how to exit the "To Do" cell
  



## To Do
When you go to the website, you can copy a block of text and insert it to search for words. For example, I will search for the "climate"


```python
string = "[insert your block of text here]"



from distutils.filelist import findall
import re
string = string.lower()

if 'climate' in string:
    print('yes!')
else:
    print('not in file')

This new paragraph will have some `variable` inline code when I find one applicable for this project.
